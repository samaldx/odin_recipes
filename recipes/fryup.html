        There's nothing like starting the day right and what feels more right
        than a good old fashioned fry up! Nothing, obviously.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, we're vegan here so no egg, if you want a good replacement for
        them <em>scrambled</em> tofu is great but thats a whole other recipe which
        we will not be covering here (duckduckgo it or something!?) Anyway
        ingredients! Here we go!
    </p>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>Hash browns</li>
        <li>Baked beans</li>
        <li>A couple of slices of toast</li>
        <li>Sausages</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Something green like kale</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Spread</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Now put it all together like this;
    </p>
    <ol class="order">
        <li>Preheat the oven.</li>
        <li>Pop the hash browns in the oven.</li>
        <li>Cut up the garlic, kale and mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Maybe put the sausages in the oven now, idk what sausages you 
            picked, check the packet.</li>
        <li>Put the beans on the hob at a low heat, add appropriate amount 
            of hot sauce.</li>
        <li>Flip the hash browns and check on the saus.</li>
        <li>Fry the mushrooms and garlic.</li>
        <li>If I hadn't made it clear already you should probably be
             adding salt and pepper to everything.</li>
        <li>Put bread in the toaster and boil kale.</li>
        <li>Add spread to toast, drain kale and put it all on the plate.</li>
        <li>Add a little more salt, maybe a small amount of hot sauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You've officially had the best possible breakfast now go out there
        and <strong>kick some butt!</strong>
