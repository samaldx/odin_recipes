        Its your favourite, its my favourite! Lets just face facts and
        admit that pizza is the greatest single invention of all time.
        At the same time homemade pizza, while usually being a lot
        healthier is also a lot more time consuming and when pizza is 
        needed most (ie hangovers) these are actually pizza negatives
        which will bring your pizza enjoyment down. How do we fix this?
        Simple! We order one from a professional pizza maker!

        Now, pizza can be pretty subjective, for example I am vegan so
        don't come at me with meat feast. You might like it greasier, or
        with a particular cheese. Basically what I'm trying to say is don't
        be afraid to experiment with takeaways, there are some real nice 
        independant places near me but sometimes I just need a big dirty
        stuffed crust one, you know what I mean? Anyway enough rambling, things
        you'll need for takeaway pizza are;
    </p>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>An internet connection</li>
        <li>1 device that connects to said internet connection</li>
        <li>1 bank card/paypal account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From here we need to</p>
    <ol class="order">
        <li>Use your device to search for local <strong>pizza</strong> 
            takeaways (this can be done through the use of an app or 
            through your web browser.)</li>
         <li>Choose from their menu.</li>
         <li>Make the payment.</li>
         <li>Wait for it to turn up.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Quick extra tip here, always get sauces! Garlic mayo is brilliant
        hot sauce too, both take crusts to the next level!
