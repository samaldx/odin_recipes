    <img src="../img/soup.jpeg" alt="A bowl of butternut squash soup,
    with fresh herbs and some bread, yum!" width="350px">
    <p>Super easy to make and <em>well good for you</em>, not only that but you
        can probably smash it out in 40 minutes if you don't faff as much
        as I do when cooking! One thing I extra like about soups is they
        are perfect food for batch cooking!
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh I forgot to mention that its real tasty and cheap too 
        didn't I? You can go all out adding fresh herbs and creme fraiche
        <strong>(the vegan stuff obviously,)</strong> but even then its hardly going all out! 
        Anyway, now I've got you all hankering for soup here's an ingredients
        list that'll serve 4!
    </p>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 large butternut squash</li>
        <li>Cannelloni beans (butter beans work great too)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>Coriander (fresh is best but dry is fine)</li>
        <li>Chilli powder</li>
        <li>500ml of bouillon</li>
        <li>Oil for the pan</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Now to <strong>bosh</strong> that all together like this;
    </p>
    <ol class="order">
        <li>Cut up the garlic, onions and butternut squash.</li>
        <li>Drain the beans.</li>
        <li>Whack the oil in a pan on a medium heat, then add the garlic and onions until brown.</li>
        <li>Add the chilli powder and some salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Add the butternut squash till they start to soften.</li>
        <li>Next add the stock and beans, this is the best time to add the dry coriander.</li>
        <li>Stir, bring to a boil and cover for 20 mins or the squash is super soft.</li>
        <li>Blend it all up!</li>
        <li>Bowl up, you can add some creme fraiche and fresh coriander if you're feeling real fancy!</li>
    </ol>
